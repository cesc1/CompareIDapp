Compare ID application
================

# Intoduction

This is a Shiny application that gives a UI to the
[compareid](https://github.com/cesc1/CompareID) R package.

This package helps merge tables from different sources, where the
columns with an identifier should match. For example, cartographic data
about city regions (id = name of the city), and statistical data about
these regions (id = name of the city). It might be that some of the city
names are written differently, use capital letters, or have changed the
name at some point in time. This app helps you detect these differences
and fix them.
